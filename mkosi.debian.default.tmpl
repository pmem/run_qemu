  # Trixie needs this one for compiling ndctl, but no such package in
  # Bookworm.  ?(exact-name ...) is used as a trick not to fail when
  # it's missing.  We can't use mkosi [Match] yet because it's too
  # recent.  If this grows out of control then we should switch to
  # run_qemu.sh concatenating different files based on the revision.
